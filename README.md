# Python Package for Bayesian Calibration from Telemac Simulations
***
***Project's name***
"Advances" on a Python package for Bayesian calibration from Telemac Simulations

***Project purpose/description:***
This projects aims to make significant development and contribution on creating a Bayesian Calibration package in Python using (this time) numerical simulations in Telemac 2D. Bayesian calibration techniques require a huge number of model simulations to perform statistical analysis in light of measured data. This is ,in fact, unfeasible when running numerical models may requiere several hours just for one realization. To make this possible, surrogate models (reduced models) are constructed with only __a few number of model realizations__. In this context, the main purpose relies on the creation of a package which could be able to run multiple simulations of Telemac as the base of a surrogate model construction and proceeding with the subsequent Bayesian calibration. The original code is based on the work made by Mouris, K. et al (2023) applied to a reservoir model calibration. 

***Motivation:***

Extracting the required data such as user input parameters for calibration purposes from a unique Excel file .xlsx.
Automating the process of running Telemac simulations the requiered times to construct a surrogate model.
Extending the use of the package with other hydrodyamic numerical softwares. 
 

***Goal:***: Create a package which is able to run the multiple simulation of Telemac and along with the Bayesian calibration
The project focuses on three main tasks:
* Running a Telemac model through Python several times as a baseline to construct a surrogate model for calibration purposes.
* Managing simulation output files .slf to extract relevant data for calibration purposes.
* Performing statistical analysis from the data obtained from the Telemac output files .slf

## Requirements
To use this Python package, we have decided to use a Linux Mint operating system which is a popular and user-friendly Linux distribution. One of the main reasons why the package runs in Linux is because Telemac is primarily developed and tested on Linux-based systems. It gives us the flexibility for configuring the environment and optimizing settings for Telemac simulations while providing a powerful command-line interface, which is well-suited for running batch simulations, automating tasks which improves the productivity of the code when managing large data sets. 

The creation of a virtual machine with the following characteristics is required:


### Virtual Machine
The Virtual Machine configuration for this project is detailed below. For further information about the creation of a virtual machine, please visit the provided [Virtual Machine](https://hydro-informatics.com/get-started/vm.html)
* Operationg System: Linux Mint Xfce 21.2
* Storage: SATA 64 GB
* Software
  * QGIS
  * Telemac V8p4r0 (MPI distribution and Metis 5.1.0)
  * Python 3
  * PyCharm Community Edition
* Python Library
  * matplotlib
  * mpi4py
  * numpy

##Installation and run a project 

Firstly, download the package and copy it to a desired folder. The download version of the package has some folders and scripts  which are explained in detail in the following lines: 
Once you download the package you will see these folders. 

## Usage Instructions
To use this package, ensure the mentioned software and Python libraries are installed:
* Upon the initial launch of the VM, the first essential task is to update the system (which should be performed periodically):
  * Open Terminal.
  * Enter the command: `sudo apt update`
  * Execute: `sudo apt full-upgrade`.
  * Conclude with: `sudo apt autoremove` to remove outdated packages.
* If any required software is missing, install it using the command
  ```
  sudo apt install app_name
  ``` 
* Conversely, if you need to uninstall a software use the command, (make sure to change the `app_name` with software name)
  ```
  sudo apt install app_name
  ```
* Run Telemac 
  * To run Telemac simulations, ensure that Telemac is installed. For installation instructions, refer to [Telemac](https://opentelemac.org/index.php/installation).
  * To run multiple Telemac simulations, follow these steps:
    * Update (file_name.xlsl)
      1. Locate the .xlsl file at the specified location. 
      2. Choose the number of runs to simulate. 
      3. Update the values of required parameters, editing only the cells highlighted in orange color. ***Warning: Do not edit anything else.***
      4. Save and close the .xlsl file. 
    * Activating Environment: This package employs a virtual environment, with the activation script named `activateHBCtelemac.sh`. To activate this environment:
      1. Navigate to the directory containing the activation script:
       ```
       cd modeling/hybayescalpycourse/env-scripts
       ```
      2. Press Enter to execute the command.
      3. Activate the environment using:
       ```
       source activateHBCtelemac.sh
       ```

* Mesh file (`casename.slf`)
* Boundary conditions file (`casename.cli`)
* Output file (`case output.slf`)



## Data
### Input .xlsx file
Before executing the code, ensure you have the input data in an Excel (.xlsx) file. Modify this file according to the instructions provided. It should contain all the necessary parameters for running the simulation. At the end of the column, you'll find hints for specific parameters (e.g., Simulation path - hint: Copy the path from the file explorer). The results of the simulation will be stored in a sub-folder named "auto-results".
